## Sensitivity Analysis of Materials simulated via Molecular Dynamics

Two material systems are in use: graphene and aluminum
The MD code is divided for the two material system:

* Al_'property'
* graphene_'property'

The two folders provide the python code to generate:

* Surrogate models for optimization
* Main Effects and Interaction effects
* Cross-validation methods
* Plots
